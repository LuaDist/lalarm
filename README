This is an alarm library for Lua 5.0. It depends on signal and SIGALRM,
which should be available in any POSIX system.

To try the library, just edit Makefile to reflect your installation of Lua.
Then run make. This will build the library and run a simple test.
For detailed installation instructions, see

	http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/lua/install.html

The library exports a single function: alarm(s,[f]). It tells Lua to call f
after s seconds have elapsed. This is done only once. If you want f to be
called every s seconds, call alarm(s) inside f. See test.lua, which shows
the library in action.

This code is hereby placed in the public domain.
Please send comments, suggestions, and bug reports to lhf@tecgraf.puc-rio.br .
